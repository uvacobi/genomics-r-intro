title: Setup
---

This lesson is an additional lesson to [the genomics workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/). Below, is a detailed setup instructions for the main workshop which can also be found on [the main setup page](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/setup.html). If you are only here for the Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics lesson, and do not wish to work on the cloud, you can go for option B below where you will only need to [download the data files](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454) to your local working directory where you will create the r-project in.

## R Genomics workshop setup directions

For general setup for the genomics lessons, see that page of [the genomics workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/).




## Installing R

This workshop is designed to be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services (AWS)
instances. With the exception of a spreadsheet program, all of the software and data used in the workshop are hosted on an Amazon. However, it is beneficial to understand how to install both R and RStudio locally (on your own machine).

Typically we suggest you install R for your operating instructions from Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Linux

Follow the CRAN instructions for your [Linux Distribution](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/); The instructions for Ubuntu are [found here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/).

## Installing RStudio

The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) is a popular way to use R. We will cover what RStudio is in the lesson. All operating systems can go to the Posit LLC [download pages](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download the appropriate version for their operating system. In most cases, the Posit website will detect your operating system and suggest the correct download. This same page will link to alternatives.
